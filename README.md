# Monitor-Security-with-Azure-Security-Center
Howdy! These are the exercise files for my Pluralsight course *Monitor Security with Azure Security Center*, part of the AZ-500 preparation path. There are not many exercise files for this course because almost all of it is done in the portal with Azure Security Center. You will need some resources for modules 3 and 4, so I have included ARM templates to build out infrastructure for both.

I also have included directions for pushing a highly insecure container to an Azure Container Registry. DO NOT use this container for ANYTHING. It was intentionally designed to be insecure for InfoSec training and vulnerability detection. And it does those two things really well.

All resources should be created in a subscription that has the Azure Defender plan in Security Center enabled. This used to be called the Standard tier, but Microsoft loves to rename things and make me redo all of my courses. Grrr....

Good luck on the course and with your AZ-500 exam!
